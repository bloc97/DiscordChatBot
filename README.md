Discord API Bot Wrapper, WIP

When finished, this wrapper will allow native complex state machines for Discord Bots.  
>What are State Machines?  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine

>Why is that useful?  
It is useful for :  
Machine learning  
Natural Language Processing  
Logic Tree AI  

>And what are those useful for?  
Ok, if you don't know what those are you are on the wrong project page...

>Why abstract one level further, when there are already Discord.js, Eris, Discord.Net, etc.?  
All Discord APIs in javascript are event based, and it is easier to implement an AI with all the events being synchronised.  
This API will allow dynamic module loading, which further simplifies the implementation of a state machine.
