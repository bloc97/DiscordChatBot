# DiscordChatBot
Side project to the main DiscordChatBot branch

This discord bot uses Algebrite and Mathjs. 
This could not be possible without them and their hard work maintaining those libraries.  

It currently supports symbolic integration, derivation, sums and products.

Much more is planned, such as:

Huge number exponentiation/factorial  
Gamma function  
Vector, matrices  
Taylor Expansion  
Root solve  
Jacobian, Hessian, Hilbert matrices  
Factors  
Rationalization  
Simplification  

Base conversion  
Unit conversion  

Truth tables  
Karnaugh maps  


This currently requires these libraries:  
use npm install as needed
